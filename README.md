# Assignment 5 â€“ Recurrences and Hash Tables

## Deadline: Wednesday, March 19, 2025, 9:59 PM

## Objectives:
- Understand and get familiar with the hash table data structure and its applications.
- Solve recurrence relations using repeated substitution and the Master Theorem.
- Implement and analyze radix sort.
- Implement double hashing for collision resolution in a hash table.
- Develop a program to check word pattern matching.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of implemented algorithms.
  
---

## Instructions:

- Problems marked as **(code)** require Java programs.
- Problems marked as **(text)** require written answers in prose, algorithms (pseudo-code or code), proofs, or mathematical equations.
- **Algorithm-based answers** (pseudo-code or code) will be assessed based on logic rather than compilation.

## Problem Breakdown
### 1. Recurrence (Text)
- Solve the given recurrence relation using repeated substitution.
- Apply the Master Method to derive the solution.
- Show each step of the substitution process clearly.

### 2. Master Theorem (Text)
- Apply the Master Method to five different recurrence relations.
- Justify the results using case analysis.
- Explain why each recurrence fits into a specific case.

### 3. Radix Sort (Text)
- Show step-by-step sorting of a given list using lexicographical order.
- Illustrate each step with an example input.

### 4. Double Hashing (Text)
- Implement a hash table with double hashing collision resolution.
- Show step-by-step insertion, collision handling, and rehashing.
- Include an explanation of how the secondary hash function is chosen.

### 5. Radix Sort (Code)
- Implement radix sort for lexicographically sorting an array of strings.
- Ensure correct handling of lowercase letters.
- Extend support for uppercase letters (Extra Credit).

### 6. Word Pattern (Code)
- Implement a function to check if a string follows a pattern with a given delimiter.
- Use a hash map for efficient pattern matching.
- Support different delimiters.

### 7. Algorithm Analysis (Text)
- Analyze the time and space complexity of implemented algorithms.
- Provide worst-case, best-case, and average-case complexity where applicable.
- Discuss trade-offs in terms of memory usage and performance.

### 8. Extra Credit: Subarray Sum (Code)
- Implement a function to find a contiguous subarray that sums to a target value.
- Optimize to achieve O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
- Use a sliding window or prefix sum approach.
